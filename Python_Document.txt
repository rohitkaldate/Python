Python:

':' is termed as "doc string"

**class: acts as blue print plan/model/design
**object: physical existence of the class

Ex1: Scenario is to build building for customers
     class :Plan 
     object: Building

**How to define class in python?

**Syntax:
class class_name:
	''' doc string ''':(Description of the class or code)
	properties(variables)
	methods

** In python OOPs 3 types of variables:
1. Instance variables(object level variables)
2. Static Variables(Class Level variables)
3. Local Variables(method level variables)


** 3 types of method allowed in python class:
1.Instance Method
2.Class Method
3.Static Method

** Reference Variable:
	-It can be used to refer the object.
	- By using reference variable we can invoke functionality of object.
	-For single object , there may be multiple references

Ex: Assume TV is an object and to operate the TV we require the remote and that remote we called as reference object.

EX: 
class Student:
	def __init__(self):  ## This is constructor method
		self.name='Rohit'
		self.roll=101
		self.marks=90
	def talk(self):
		print("Hello I'm:",self.name)
		print("Roll no is:",self.roll)
		print("My marks are:",self.marks)
s=Student()
print(s.name)
print(s.roll)
print(s.marks)
## Call method from class using reference variable 
s.talk()
